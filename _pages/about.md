<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Lecturer in the School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China. Before joining the university, I was a Research Fellow in the School of Computer Science at the University of St Andrews, working on the TeamPlay project under the supervison of Dr. Christopher Brown, and a Research Associate in the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG) at the University of Warwick, working on the PETRAS project supervised by Prof. Carsten Maple. 

I have a PhD degree from Department of Computer Science at University of Warwick, supervised by Prof. [Arshad Jhumka](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/computing/staff/14238/professor-arshad-jhumka). I also received my BSc in Applied Computing from Northumbria University in the Newcastle Upon Tyne, and MSc in Computer Science and Applications from University of Warwick.

<!--  I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
